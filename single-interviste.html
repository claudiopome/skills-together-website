    <h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-6xl pt-20 pb-10 text-center">Technical and vocational education, market signalling
        today.
        A conversation with Michael Spence</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Daniele Fano, Milan, November 27 2015</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I have had the privilege of asking Michael Spence, who is very active in the current economic
        debates especially around the issues of employment ad growth, his thoughts about the project of a platform for
        signalling the quality of vocational training and technical education.
        Michael Spence was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2001. He has given a major contribution to our
        understanding of the relationship between education and labor markets. Specifically, he has shown that, given
        the asymmetries of information between those looking for jobs (labor supply) and those who are willing to hire
        (labor demand), schools and universities
        play a key role in signalling the quality of prospective employees. The more so, as interactions in the labor
        market happen, as far the single individuals are concerned, at distant moments in time. But can the current
        changes in information technology make a difference? And doesn’t the sheer speed of innovation raise new
        difficult challenges?
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">Three questions:</p>
    <p class="mb-4">1. You wrote your pathbreaking article Job Market Signalling just over 40
        years ago. What main message would you consider still important nowadays? Should you
        write your article again, is there anything you would like to add or change?
        I think the basic principles still apply. There are informational gaps and asymmetries in important markets,
        like labor markets. Signals help close these gaps, but at some cost. Effective signals, that is those that
        survive in market equilibria, are those that have costs that are negatively correlated with the valued but
        unobservable (at the time of the transaction) characteristics. At the time, no one saw the explosion of
        information available on the internet. So platforms like Amazon, Linkedin, Airbnb, become powerful in part by
        expanding markets and in part by “solving” the trust problem via evaluation systems on both intervening parties.
        We knew back in the 70’s that the incentive structures of repeated games are different from the point of view of
        information disclosure. But we didn’t see the power of digital technology to shift the scope and informational
        structure of markets. If I were writing now, that would be a mandatory addition.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        2. What role do you see for technical and vocational education in our times of rapid changes in technology and
        labor markets? How important is it to invest in one’s skills and update them?
        The data we have suggests that globalization has expanded the global economy and prosperity broadly, but it has
        also shifted jobs in manufacturing from developed to developing countries. Digital technology, and specifically
        automation of codifiable jobs, is removing routine white and blue collar employment from all economies, first in
        developed and then in developing economies. In my view, the speed of this transformation has put labor markets
        out of long run equilibrium.
        Jobs have to shift to a wide range of services that are complementary to the new technologies. This means
        reconfiguring the supply side of labor markets by shifting the skills mix toward rapidly evolving demand.
        Technical and vocational education properly targeted is therefore a crucial part</p>
